# TQ-Mini
The TQ-Mini is an Arduino based 8 DOF quadruped, which can be controlled via Bluetooth with an Android App.

## Hardware:
- Arduino Pro Mini (5V, 16MHz)
- Bluetooth module HC-05 or HC-06
- 8x SG90 (KY66) Servos
- Battery, e.g. 2S LiPo (7,4V)
- DC-DC buck converter (7,4V of the battery to 5V). I used the LM2596. 
- Resistors (1k Ohm and 2k Ohm) for the voltage devider
- Material for the frame. I used wood with a thickness of 5mm, 6mm would be better.
- 4x6cm Prototype PCB (perfboard)
